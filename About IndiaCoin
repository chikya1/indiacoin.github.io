<h1> About IndiaCoin </h1>

Welcome to the IndiaCoin

IndiaCoin (IND) is an aspirational project. The thought process behind it, was to show that, anyone can make crypto currency and also to increase awareness of BlockChain and Crypto field in India. Hi, I am the founder of IndiaCoin. I am not a coder, learned everything about Cryptos & BlockChain from articles and YouTube, and also by following people like "[Vitalik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin)".

I would like to create a pool of Cryptographers and would also like India/Indians to start investing in BlockChain Technology Research and focus on `How this tech can be used in our day to day life?`

For this purpose, I am announcing that, if this coin starts getting popular, I am reserving 20% of the total supply for the Government of India, if they choose to accept. Also, with the profits I receive from IndiaCoin, I will invest them in BlockChain research projects in our country.
